This was built while learning a tutorial and with solidity version 0.4.17
An updated version will be released soon.

##Testing locally
run `npm init` to install all packages
run `npm run test`

##Testing On Remix
You can test the deployment on Remix Using Metamask or similar wallets, using this address `0x8Ab84Dab34B18Bd86496c997771E89cC45eD43e5`. It only available on Rinkeby Test Network. 

The contract must be [compiled on Remix before it is set to work](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/49376/how-to-load-contract-from-address-remix/49377)

This mostly won't work as the code is hardcoded to work with my address, I will making changes on that soon.
